# VNC Web Server

This project is a self-contained server that provides a web interface and a RESTful API to control VNC sessions. It uses FastAPI for the backend, WebSockets for real-time screen streaming, and includes an interactive API documentation page.

## Key Features

*   **Web-based VNC Viewer**: Access and interact with VNC sessions directly from your browser.
*   **RESTful API**: Programmatically control VNC actions like mouse movement, clicks, drags, and keyboard input.
*   **Real-time Screen Updates**: Leverages WebSockets to stream the VNC framebuffer with low latency.
*   **Interactive API Documentation**: A clean, modern documentation interface is available at the root endpoint, generated by Scalar.
*   **Dynamic Session Management**: VNC connection objects are created on-demand and cleaned up automatically.

## API Endpoints

The API allows for granular control over a VNC session specified by its `host` and `port`.

*   `GET /vnc/{host}:{port}/api/screenshot`: Retrieves a PNG screenshot of the current view.
*   `POST /vnc/{host}:{port}/api/move`: Moves the mouse cursor to the specified coordinates.
*   `POST /vnc/{host}:{port}/api/click`: Performs a mouse click at the specified coordinates.
*   `POST /vnc/{host}:{port}/api/scroll`: Simulates a mouse wheel scroll action.
*   `POST /vnc/{host}:{port}/api/drag`: Drags the mouse from a start point to an end point.
*   `POST /vnc/{host}:{port}/api/type`: Types a string of text.
*   `POST /vnc/{host}:{port}/api/shortcut`: Executes a key combination, such as Ctrl+C.

For detailed request body schemas, please refer to the interactive documentation on the main page.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository or create the files**
    Create a project directory and place the `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md` files inside it.

2.  **Create a virtual environment**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    Install all the required packages using pip.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Server

To start the application, run the `main.py` script.

```sh
python main.py
